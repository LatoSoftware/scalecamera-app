Kayla Grant, for putting up with me all year. </string>
	<string name="instr_content">\"Load Image\" and pick or capture a picture. Touch two points on the image, \"Set Scale\", and enter real-life distance. Touch two other points, \"Compute\", enter a unique label to describe the measurement. \n\"Show Table\" lists all measurements, ready to \"Send as Email\" or go back to main screen.\nAfter \"Load Video\", you must \"Play\" it to see anything.</string>
<!--	<string name="instr_str">Load an image or video using the appropriate button, then touch points on the image (a video will need to be played and paused before measuring) to select a scale distance. Touch \"Set Scale\" and enter the real-life mesuarement for the distance you\'ve selected. Now you\'re ready to measure! Touch points as before and \"Compute\" to calculate the real-life distance. Each computed distance needs a unique string to identify it, describing the measurement you have made. All the distances are collected in the Table screen (\"Show Table\") and from there, may be emailed on to collaborators.</string>-->
